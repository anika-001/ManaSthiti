<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


## The problem ManaSthiti solves
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.
There is a stigma surrounding mental illness that needs to be cast away and people need to be made aware so that they seek help at the right time.

People are less receptive to ideas that are just told or shown and are more receptive to ideas that are presented in an interactive manner.

Our application is an interactive platform that is dedicated to spread awareness about mental health issues and manage mental health while building a safe community together.

• Mood Tracker
It helps the user keep track of their emotions. We've created this keeping in mind that a person if feeling down for fifteen consecutive days, isadvised to visit a doctor to get further help. Moreover User could also get motivated seeing the amazing lineup of the vibrant colors! A personal diarly has also been added to keep their mood and thoughts at the same place amazingly!

Various comics focousing on Menatl health are added in the section, will help normalize the environment and also add a little fun time to the day!

• Forum to Discuss
In today's day where Mental health is considered a taboo, there is also an essential need for people suffering to reach out and share what they're feeling. Here they can either being public or anonymously share their views on some specefic topic or create some new threads and share their heart out!

• Various Games
